# Bubble Smash!

This little page is just a bunch of bubbles floating up a gradient sky. A couple of CSS keyframes push them upward and sideways at different speeds, so the screen never sits still. The `pop` animation squashes them down to nothing for a quick burst before they respawn somewhere else.

You can also treat it like a mini game: click a bubble to pop it and watch your score climb in the corner. Hit Reset to scramble the bubbles and start fresh. Nothing fancy, just a quick, clicky stress break using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
